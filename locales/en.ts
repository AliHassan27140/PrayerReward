      {
        question: "Why should one pray?",

        verse: "Philippians 4:6-7: 'Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.'"
      },
      {
        question: "Why is it good to pray?",
        answer: "Prayer is good because it helps us focus on what really matters and strengthen our relationship with God. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our lives and find solutions through spiritual guidance.",
        verse: "Matthew 7:7: 'Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.'"
      },
      {
        question: "Why do people pray?",
        answer: "We pray to express our gratitude, ask for help or guidance, and build a stronger relationship with God. Prayer is a way to remind us of God's presence and His will in our lives.",
        verse: "James 5:16: 'Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.'"
      },
      {
        question: "What happens when you pray?",
        answer: "When we pray, we open our hearts to God. We create a space for reflection and spiritual renewal. Prayer brings us closer to God and helps us hear His voice and understand His will.",
        verse: "Matthew 6:6: 'But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.'"
      },
      {
        question: "How does one pray?",
        answer: "Prayer is a personal act and can be done in many ways. A basic method is to start by focusing your thoughts on God, acknowledging His presence, and speaking openly to Him. Prayer can be thanksgiving, a request for help, or a moment to seek peace. Jesus gave us an example in the 'Lord's Prayer' where we ask for forgiveness, help in temptation, and daily bread.",
        verse: "Matthew 6:9-13: 'This, then, is how you should pray: “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.”'"
